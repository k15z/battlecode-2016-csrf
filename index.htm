        <h1>Battlecode 2016 CSRF Exploit</h1>
        <p>
            This is a proof-of-concept demonstrating the CSRF vulnerability present on the 
            Battlecode 2016 website. If you are logged in to Battlecode and you click on 
            the below link, the bio field of your team's profile will be changed to "This 
            team was pwned!"; this can be easily extended to delete users/teams as well as 
            do many more evil-er things.
        </p>
